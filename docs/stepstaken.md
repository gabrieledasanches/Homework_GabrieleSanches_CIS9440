# Car Crashes in New York City 

### Data
Found the data on NYC open data, and got the api url to use it in a python scripot to get the data

First, I checked if the code was working for 1000 rows only (script_tets.py), after I did the Web API for the full data set (webapi_data)

After getting the data, I got the data dictionary and stored it on github as well.
